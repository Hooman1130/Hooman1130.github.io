            <p>Suspect of Interest:<br>
            <span>Dr Edward Armstrong</span></p>
            <p>Physical Appearance &amp; Facts:<br>
            <span>Dr Edward Armstrong is a fairly athletic middle aged successful Physician. He always has a tense look on his face and is highly skilled in his field of expertise.</span> 
            </p>
            <p>Criminal History/ Prior Affiliation:<br>
            <span>By the gramophone recording he was accused of causing the death of Louisa Mary Clees.<br>“<em>Edward George Armstrong, that you did upon the 14th day of March, 1925, cause the death of Louisa Mary Clees.</em>”<br>He is also somehow connected to the case of Edward Seton, as he was able to recall details from it.</span>

                <p>Evidence:</p>
                <p><span>“<em>Drunk—that's what it was—drunk... And I operated! Nerves all to pieces—hands shaking. I killed her all right.</em>” — Page 71, Armstrong's thoughts</span></p>
                <p><span>“<em>Everything points to one of the cyanides. No distinctive smell of Prussic Acid, probably Potassium Cyanide. It acts pretty well instantaneously</em>” — Page 76, Armstrong out loud.</span></p>
                <p><span>“<em>How beautifully sharp it was....<br>
                Easy to do a murder with a knife like that. And of course he </em>was<em> doing a murder....</em>” — Page 91, in Armstrong's dreams.</span></p>
                <p><span>“<em>It was Emily Brent that he had to kill.</em>” — Page 93, in Armstrong's dreams.</span></p>
                <p><span>“<em>Murder in Hospital. Murder on the Operating Table. Safe—yes, safe as houses!</em>” — Page 115, Armstrong's thoughts</span></p>

                <p><span>“<em>Look here, doctor, you did give her some dope, you know.</em>”<br>“<em>Last night. You said yourself you'd given her something to make her sleep.</em>” — Page 140, Blore accusing Armstrong</span></p>
